      <h1>The Generative AI Revolution I Witnessed</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve been in the generative AI space since its very first heartbeats. Throughout this journey, I&#8217;ve had the chance to try <em>every technology</em>, <em>every innovation</em>, <em>every model</em> that came out. I&#8217;ve built countless projects and even contributed to many of them.</p>

<h2>The Early Days: Criticism and Doubt</h2>

<p>In the early days, it was criticized for <strong><em>inadequate and random outputs</em></strong> (language models included). Then came the critiques that it would <strong>never reach human-level performance</strong>. During the period when it couldn&#8217;t produce sufficiently realistic outputs but succeeded in more abstract arts, there were small pushbacks mixed with mild fear, claiming <em>"this isn&#8217;t real art"</em> - it was even dismissed. When realism improved, everyone was impressed, but simultaneously there were attempts to build public opinion that <strong>"we should stop AI."</strong></p>

<h2>Today: Ubiquitous and Indispensable</h2>

<p>Today, we&#8217;ve reached a point where it&#8217;s <strong><em>everywhere in our lives</em></strong>. It accelerates our work, solves many of our problems, and we can barely distinguish it anymore. But it&#8217;s certain that it <strong>empowers us</strong> and we don&#8217;t want to remove it from our lives.</p>

<p>Throughout this entire development process, I noticed one thing: <strong><em>no matter what, if a thread starts to unravel, there will always be people who pull it all the way through</em></strong>. I was part of that, and I always advocated for it.</p>

<h2>The Relentless Push Forward</h2>

<p>During this process, all developers worked both for <strong>better outputs</strong> and to run more efficiently on <strong>lower-end hardware</strong>. No matter what anyone said, someone always kept going and believed. When they hit a wall or reached a limit, they didn&#8217;t stop - they <strong><em>changed the game</em></strong> and pushed the boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">latent diffusion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">flash attention</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA">low-rank adaptation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/peft">PEFT</a>, AI tooling, <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">agent MCP</a> - the list goes on</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Innovation Cascade</h2>

<p>If you noticed, throughout the entire development cycle, people continuously created new things until they reached <strong>saturation in each respective area</strong>.</p>

<p>We generated images with <a href="https://github.com/alembics/disco-diffusion"><em>Disco Diffusion</em></a> - low resolution, taking minutes. Latent upscalers came along, and we tried to enlarge those small images. Depth estimation models were invented, we did the first video experiments with <em>depth warp</em> and <em>optical flow</em>. <a href="https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion"><em>Stable Diffusion</em></a> arrived, prompts got optimized, images became more promising. <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers"><em>xFormers</em></a> came and everything <strong><em>accelerated incredibly</em></strong>. We saw models that could produce outputs in just <strong>4-5 steps</strong>. We started conditioning those invented depth models with <a href="https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet"><em>ControlNet</em></a> for style transfer, and so on. We saw the first <em>text2video</em> models, with audio models added in parallel.</p>

<h2>Where We Stand Today</h2>

<p>Where we stand today, they&#8217;ve reached <strong><em>cinematic quality</em></strong> - voices are <strong>nearly impossible</strong> to distinguish. I&#8217;m not even talking about language models. AI opposition has vanished, and the limits of <em>"language models and image models can only do this much"</em> have disappeared.</p>

<h2>The Most Beautiful Part</h2>

<p>The most beautiful part is that almost everything was done <strong>open source</strong>. In other words, the world&#8217;s most important technology right now was realized and developed through the <strong><em>collective effort of all people worldwide</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>That&#8217;s a spine-tingling feeling, in my opinion.</em></p>
