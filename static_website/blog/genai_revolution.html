      <h1>The Generative AI Revolution I Witnessed</h1>

<p>I've been in the generative AI space since its very first heartbeats. Throughout this journey, I've had the chance to try _every technology_, _every innovation_, _every model_ that came out. I've built countless projects and even contributed to many of them.</p>

<h2>The Early Days: Criticism and Doubt</h2>

<p>In the early days, it was criticized for <strong>_inadequate and random outputs_</strong> (language models included). Then came the critiques that it would <strong>never reach human-level performance</strong>. During the period when it couldn't produce sufficiently realistic outputs but succeeded in more abstract arts, there were small pushbacks mixed with mild fear, claiming _"this isn't real art"_ - it was even dismissed. When realism improved, everyone was impressed, but simultaneously there were attempts to build public opinion that *<em>"we should stop AI."</em>*</p>

<h2>Today: Ubiquitous and Indispensable</h2>

<p>Today, we've reached a point where it's <strong>_everywhere in our lives_</strong>. It accelerates our work, solves many of our problems, and we can barely distinguish it anymore. But it's certain that it <strong>empowers us</strong> and we don't want to remove it from our lives.</p>

<p>Throughout this entire development process, I noticed one thing: <strong>_no matter what, if a thread starts to unravel, there will always be people who pull it all the way through_</strong>. I was part of that, and I always advocated for it.</p>

<h2>The Relentless Push Forward</h2>

<p>During this process, all developers worked both for <strong>better outputs</strong> and to run more efficiently on <strong>lower-end hardware</strong>. No matter what anyone said, someone always kept going and believed. When they hit a wall or reached a limit, they didn't stop - they <strong>_changed the game_</strong> and pushed the boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">latent diffusion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">flash attention</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA">low-rank adaptation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/peft">PEFT</a>, AI tooling, <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">agent MCP</a> - the list goes on</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Innovation Cascade</h2>

<p>If you noticed, throughout the entire development cycle, people continuously created new things until they reached <strong>saturation in each respective area</strong>.</p>

<p>We generated images with <a href="https://github.com/alembics/disco-diffusion">_Disco Diffusion_</a> - low resolution, taking minutes. Latent upscalers came along, and we tried to enlarge those small images. Depth estimation models were invented, we did the first video experiments with _depth warp_ and _optical flow_. <a href="https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion">_Stable Diffusion_</a> arrived, prompts got optimized, images became more promising. <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers">_xFormers_</a> came and everything <strong>_accelerated incredibly_</strong>. We saw models that could produce outputs in just <strong>4-5 steps</strong>. We started conditioning those invented depth models with <a href="https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet">_ControlNet_</a> for style transfer, and so on. We saw the first _text2video_ models, with audio models added in parallel.</p>

<h2>Where We Stand Today</h2>

<p>Where we stand today, they've reached <strong>_cinematic quality_</strong> - voices are <strong>nearly impossible</strong> to distinguish. I'm not even talking about language models. AI opposition has vanished, and the limits of _"language models and image models can only do this much"_ have disappeared.</p>

<h2>The Most Beautiful Part</h2>

<p>The most beautiful part is that almost everything was done <strong>open source</strong>. In other words, the world's most important technology right now was realized and developed through the <strong>_collective effort of all people worldwide_</strong>.</p>

<p>_That's a spine-tingling feeling, in my opinion._</p>
